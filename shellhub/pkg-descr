ShellHub is a centralized SSH gateway that allows users to remotely
access and manage their servers and devices from anywhere, using a web
browser or mobile app. It offers a secure and convenient way to
connect and control your servers and devices.

The ShellHub's Agent is a lightweight software component that runs the
device and provide communication between this device and ShellHub's
server. Its main role is to provide a reserve SSH server always
connected to the ShellHub server, allowing SSH connections to be
established to the device even when it is behind a firewall or NAT.
